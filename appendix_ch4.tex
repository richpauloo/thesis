\subsection{Particle trajectory coordinate rotation and travel time normalization via the characteristic travel time}
\label{s_ap_c_part_rot}

In order to ensure comparability across the range of VHGR scenarios of differing travel times and mean flow direction, we perform coordinate rotations and normalize travel times by a characteristic travel time to travel the average facies length, $t_c$. 

First, we compute the mean Lagrangian velocity across all trajectories, $\bar{v}$ and use the characteristic time to travel the average facies length, $t_c$, to normalize time across VHGR scenarios (SI Appendix Table S1). The mean velocity and facies length are calculated along the direction of mean flow. Since this direction varies across VHGR, by an angle $\Phi$ relative to the horizontal direction, and the model outputs trajectories in a regular 3D Cartesian grid, we rotate the particle trajectory coordinates about the $x$ axis by $\Phi$ to recover the the transformed $y$ and $z$ components along the longitudinal and transverse vertical directions respectively ($y’$ and $z’$):

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:rotation}
    y' = z \cdot sin(\Phi) + y \cdot cos(\Phi) \\
    z' = z \cdot cos(\Phi) - y \cdot sin(\Phi)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Flow occurs along $zy$, thus the $x$ coordinates (transverse horizontal) remain unchanged. After transforming coordinates according to (\ref{eq:rotation}), we calculate longitudinal displacement along $y’$, transverse vertical displacement along $z’$, and transverse horizontal displacement along $x$.
