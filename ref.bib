@article{Ransom2017,
abstract = {Intense demand for water in the Central Valley of California and related increases in groundwater nitrate concentration threaten the sustainability of the groundwater resource. To assess contamination risk in the region, we developed a hybrid, non-linear, machine learning model within a statistical learning framework to predict nitrate contamination of groundwater to depths of approximately 500 m below ground surface. A database of 145 predictor variables representing well characteristics, historical and current field and landscape-scale nitrogen mass balances, historical and current land use, oxidation/reduction conditions, groundwater flow, climate, soil characteristics, depth to groundwater, and groundwater age were assigned to over 6000 private supply and public supply wells measured previously for nitrate and located throughout the study area. The boosted regression tree (BRT) method was used to screen and rank variables to predict nitrate concentration at the depths of domestic and public well supplies. The novel approach included as predictor variables outputs from existing physically based models of the Central Valley. The top five most important predictor variables included two oxidation/reduction variables (probability of manganese concentration to exceed 50 ppb and probability of dissolved oxygen concentration to be below 0.5 ppm), field-scale adjusted unsaturated zone nitrogen input for the 1975 time period, average difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration during the years 1971–2000, and 1992 total landscape nitrogen input. Twenty-five variables were selected for the final model for log-transformed nitrate. In general, increasing probability of anoxic conditions and increasing precipitation relative to potential evapotranspiration had a corresponding decrease in nitrate concentration predictions. Conversely, increasing 1975 unsaturated zone nitrogen leaching flux and 1992 total landscape nitrogen input had an increasing relative impact on nitrate predictions. Three-dimensional visualization indicates that nitrate predictions depend on the probability of anoxic conditions and other factors, and that nitrate predictions generally decreased with increasing groundwater age.},

@article{Greene2018,
abstract = {The vulnerability of food and agricultural systems to climate variability and change is extensively studied. However, the vulnerability of agricultural labor is largely ignored in climate vulnerability and adaptation studies, especially in the context of developed countries. This research examines the drought vulnerability of farmworkers both in the fields and in their communities by analyzing how changes in water resources and agricultural practices impact socioeconomic drought. A combination of surveys and semi-structured interviews with farmworkers, farmers, and social service providers in California's San Joaquin Valley is used to identify the impacts of drought on agricultural labor, water security, food security, and health. Findings demonstrate that drought impacts and vulnerabilities are multi-scalar and uneven. Agricultural drought adaptations, including increase in groundwater pumping and changes in crops, reshapes the vulnerability of farmworkers and rural communities. There is a need for continued interdisciplinary research on the socioeconomic dimensions of drought as well as increased representation of needs and vulnerabilities of farmworkers and rural communities in drought and climate change adaptation planning.},

Water compositions are restricted to SiO//2, Ca, Mg, Na, K, HCO//3, CO//3, SO//4 and Cl. Evaporation is simulated by a computer progrom and saturation tests are performed with respect to calcite, sepiolite and gypsum. When saturation occurs, the solids are removed from interaction with the brine. Calculations are terminated at an ionic strength near five. The validity of the model has been tested on several closed basins-Deep Springs, Lake Megadi, Salinevalley, Great Salt Lake and Abert Lake. The correspondence between calculated and natural brine compositions is generally very good. In fact, the model has provided new insights into the hydrology of some of these basins.},

abstract = {The development of groundwater for irrigation in Pakistan's Punjab has lowered water tables and markedly reduced the extent of waterlogged lands. However, the incidence of salinity has not been reduced at the same rate. This paper reviews IIMI's research studies in Pakistan, in which over the last five years soil and tubewell water samples have been collected at several research sites. Electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were found to be significantly higher in irrigated areas that have limited access to canal water of good quality. There are indications that farmers use irrigation water from tubewells to minimize the effects of salinity, e.g. by increasing the frequency of application when crops show signs of salt-induced water stress. Evidence is presented that farmers are not succeeding in the same way with respect to sodicity.},

@article{Hardie1970,
abstract = {The evolution of closed-basin brines has been investigated with the aid of a model based on evaporative concentration in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Water compositions are restricted to SiO//2, Ca, Mg, Na, K, HCO//3, CO//3, SO//4 and Cl. Evaporation is simulated by a computer progrom and saturation tests are performed with respect to calcite, sepiolite and gypsum. When saturation occurs, the solids are removed from interaction with the brine. Calculations are terminated at an ionic strength near five. The validity of the model has been tested on several closed basins-Deep Springs, Lake Megadi, Salinevalley, Great Salt Lake and Abert Lake. The correspondence between calculated and natural brine compositions is generally very good. In fact, the model has provided new insights into the hydrology of some of these basins.},

@article{Kijne1995,
abstract = {The development of groundwater for irrigation in Pakistan's Punjab has lowered water tables and markedly reduced the extent of waterlogged lands. However, the incidence of salinity has not been reduced at the same rate. This paper reviews IIMI's research studies in Pakistan, in which over the last five years soil and tubewell water samples have been collected at several research sites. Electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were found to be significantly higher in irrigated areas that have limited access to canal water of good quality. There are indications that farmers use irrigation water from tubewells to minimize the effects of salinity, e.g. by increasing the frequency of application when crops show signs of salt-induced water stress. Evidence is presented that farmers are not succeeding in the same way with respect to sodicity.},
